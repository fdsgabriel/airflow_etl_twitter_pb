# Twitter ETL with Airflow, EC2 and S3

The main concept here is collect tweets by the most known brazillian medias. Then is possible to know which news were shared he most by any period of time (dily, weekly or monthly).

For that, I used python to write my ETL, EC2 to run Airflow and S3 as datalake. 

Special thanks for Darshil.
